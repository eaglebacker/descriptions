    <h2>Vinyasa</h2>
    <p class="words">Likened to a dynamic dance, is a practice where postures or asanas are connected through the breath. Build heat, endurance, flexibility, and strength. Creative sequencing around surya namaskar (sun salutations), weaving together wisdom teachings and music inspire physical, energetic, mental, and pure bliss states of consciousness.

  <h2>Hatha</h2>
  <p class="words">Hatha yoga is intended to combine physical postures with breathing exercises to build strength, gain flexibility and mindful awareness. An unhurried, medium-paced class where postures may be easily adapted to suit any level of student. The practice will often combine flowing movement and breath to create and maintain flexibility of body and mind.</p>

      <p class="destitle">
<h2>Gentle</h2>
<p class="words">A harmonious fluidity of movement and breath. We begin with centering and gentle warm up exercises and then build progressively with postures that lengthen and tone all the major muscle groups. Modifications and props are incorporated to support alignment and progression. 
Begin with full yogic breathing followed by various stretching and warm-up postures to develop flexibility and turn one’s attention inward. Appropriate for all levels of experience and practice.</p>

<h2>Yin Yoga</h2>
<p class="words">Yin Yoga consists of a series of long-held, passive floor poses that mainly work the lower part of the body—the hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine. These areas are especially rich in connective tissues. The poses are held for up to five minutes, sometimes longer. Yin Yoga works on the Yin tissues - also known as the connective tissues. Connective tissue responds best to a slow, steady load. You will gently stretch connective tissue by holding a yin pose for a long time in this way, the body will respond by making them a little longer and stronger. Yin Yoga is for you if you are tired, over-stimulated, when your energy is too erratic, your mind overactive, whether you are craving for energy or you feel you have too much of it.</p>
